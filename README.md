# Social Media MVC
https://socialmediamvc.azurewebsites.net/

This is my attempt at a simple discussion board similar to Reddit with some inspiration taken from Indeed.

It uses ASP.NET Core MVC with Entity Framework Core for the backend and Bootstrap for the frontend.

## Usage
Click "Register" in the top-right corner to create an account. From there you're free to:
- Create new posts (click the "+" button next to the search bar)
- Vote on any post or comment
- Reply to any post or comment
- Save or hide any post or comment, which can be accessed later via the dropdown with your username in the top-right corner.

If you don't want to register, you're still free to browse what's already been submitted.
